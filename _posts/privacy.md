This past semester I participated in [cs2390](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2390/2021/), a seminar focused on recent work in the space of privacy-conscious computer systems. The course was led by the excellent [Malte Schwarzkopf](http://cs.brown.edu/people/malte/) and featured papers on privacy legislation, systems applications of cryptography, information flow control, and encrypted search.
