ML Chord Gen is a webapp which utilizes a custom-trained neural network to provide the user with novel chord progressions. The chord progressions are generated subject to a number of tunable parameters, and the user can play them back in-browser with a variety of instruments to use as a backing track for improvisation or to inspire new compositions.

The chords are generated by a **recurrent neural network** that was trained on a large number of jazz standards. The network uses long short-term memory layers to ensure that the chords properly flow into each other. For more details, see the Github page linked above.
