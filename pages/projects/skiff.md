Skiff is a programming language and accompanying interpreter that attempts to provide a frictionless environment for scripting and being introduced to functional programming. Features include algebraic data types, pattern matching, type inference, first-class functions, and helpful error messages. The skiff interpreter compiles to WASM so you can use the [web editor](https://skiff.paulbiberstein.me/), but it is also available as a [standalone binary on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/skiff).
