ChordalPy is a small Python package for parsing and manipulating musical chords. The package includes a chord class to represent a musical chord and a variety of methods on that class to assist with tasks such as transposition and spelling. Additionally, the package has a parsing component which enables converting text files of chords to data objects, provided they adhere to the popular standard established in [Christopher Harte's 2010 thesis](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/534/HARTETowardsAutomatic2010.pdf?sequence=1).
